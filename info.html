								The mission is underway. Players must work together to uncover hidden secrets, solve puzzles, and gather
								intelligence, all while racing against the clock. This phase is dynamic and interactive, requiring
								constant teamwork, critical thinking, and quick decision-making.
								<br>
								<br>
								1. First Clue Unveiled:
								<br>
								<br>
								The game begins with the team receiving their first clue, which will lead them to a specific location or
								task.

								challenges, the Tech Specialist handles the gadgets, and the Leader coordinates efforts.
								<br>
								<br>
								2. Decrypting Codes and Solving Puzzles:
								<br>

								around the room or the game space.

								provide critical hints when viewed under the special light.
								Files containing sensitive information will be unlocked when players discover the correct passwords or
								passcodes.
