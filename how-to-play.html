								Welcome, agents! Your mission begins now. Here's how to get started:
								<br>
								<br>
								Gather Your Team: Form your team of 4-6 players. Each member will have a key role to play, so make sure
								to assign responsibilities in advance (e.g., Analyst, Operative, Tech Specialist, Leader).
								<br>
								<br>
								Read the Briefing: Before starting, make sure everyone has read the mission briefing. It contains
								crucial information about the task at hand, the objective, and any background details you need to know
								to succeed.
								<br>
								<br>
								Receive Your First Clue: Once the game begins, the first clue will be revealed to you. This might come
								in the form of a message, riddle, or an object that leads you to your next step. Work together as a team
								to solve it.
								<br>
								<br>
								Begin Exploring: The world is full of hidden secrets. Your team must search for clues, solve puzzles,
								and unlock the next part of the story. Be careful—time is ticking!
								<br>
								<br>
								Use Your Gadgets Wisely: Throughout the game, you'll have access to various tools and gadgets. These
								might include things like magnifying glasses, listening devices, or encrypted files. Make sure to use
								them strategically to unlock clues.
								<br>
								<br>
								Work Together: Communication is key. Each team member's unique skills are necessary to succeed. Don’t
								hesitate to collaborate and share ideas.
								<br>
								<br>
								Stay Focused & Have Fun: Remember, the goal is to complete your mission before time runs out. But most
								importantly, have fun and enjoy the adventure!
